### Requirements

[fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) must be installed. termfactor uses [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) for terminal identification.

### Tests

termfactor tests your terminal for 

- `truecolor`
- `sgr or text decorations`
- `unicode`
- `emojis`
- `bidi awareness`
- `osc 8 hyperlinks`
- `osc 9 notifications`
- `osc 777 notifications`
- `sixel graphics`

please note that this is just a general test for bidirectional awareness & not a comprehensive bidi language test.
